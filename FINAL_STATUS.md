## Repository Transformation

### Before
```
69 branches
├── Multiple consolidation attempts
├── Numerous protocol branches
├── Many feature branches
├── Several bug fix branches
├── Testing branches
└── Development branches

2 open PRs
Complex branch structure
```

### After
```
2 branches
├── main (stable production)
└── cursor/kyc2 (consolidated development)
    └── All features integrated

0 open PRs
Simple, streamlined structure
```

---

## Maintenance Recommendations

### Going Forward
1. Use cursor/kyc2 for all development
2. Keep main for stable releases
3. Create feature branches sparingly
4. Merge features within days
5. Delete branches immediately after merge
6. Run git fetch --prune regularly

### If Branches Accumulate
1. Use provided consolidation scripts
2. Follow documented process
3. Maintain clean git history
4. Document consolidation decisions
