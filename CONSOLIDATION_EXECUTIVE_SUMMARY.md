## Recommendations for Future

### Maintain Current State
1. **Keep to 2-3 branches maximum**
2. **Delete feature branches within 24 hours of merge**
3. **Use short-lived feature branches (< 7 days)**
4. **Run automated consolidation weekly**

### Workflow Best Practices
1. Develop on `cursor/kyc2`
2. Merge to `main` for releases
3. Auto-merge PRs when tests pass
4. Continuous branch monitoring

### Prevention Measures
1. Set up automated stale branch detection
2. Implement branch count alerts (trigger at > 5)
3. Auto-delete merged branches via GitHub Actions
4. Weekly consolidation health checks
