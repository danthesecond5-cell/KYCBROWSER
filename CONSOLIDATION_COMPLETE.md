## Workflow Optimization

### Before Consolidation
```
67 branches → Complex navigation
Multiple merge points → Difficult tracking
Stale branches → Confusing history
Manual cleanup required
```

### After Consolidation
```
2 branches → Simple navigation
Linear history → Easy tracking
Clean state → Clear workflow
Automated maintenance
```

## Future Recommendations

### Branch Management
- Maintain 2-3 branch maximum
- Delete feature branches immediately after merge
- Use short-lived feature branches (< 7 days)
- Regular automated cleanup

### Workflow
- Develop on `cursor/kyc2`
- Merge to `main` for releases
- Auto-merge PRs when possible
- Continuous integration

### Monitoring
- Weekly branch count check
- Automated stale branch detection
- PR completion tracking
- Regular consolidation runs
